# Social-Media-Application-using-Django.

Overview: Built a feature-rich social media application with user profiles, posting, liking, and commenting on posts.
The application is designed to be scalable and responsive, handling real-time interactions and large datasets
efficiently.

Technological Innovation: This project leverages Django REST Framework to build robust APIs and incorporates
WebSockets for real-time notifications, ensuring users receive immediate updates on likes, comments, and new
posts. Unlike many existing social media platforms, this application focuses on delivering a seamless and interactive
user experience with real-time feedback.

REST API Knowledge: The project involves the development of comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
APIs, allowing for full control over posts, comments, and likes. The APIs are optimized for performance and security,
providing a solid backend for any social media platform.

Impact: The applicationâ€™s real-time capabilities and robust API structure make it superior to many existing social
media applications that suffer from latency issues and limited interactivity. It is ideal for environments where user
engagement and real-time communication are critical.
